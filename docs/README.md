AskOmics is a visual SPARQL query interface supporting both intuitive data integration and querying while shielding the user from most of the technical difficulties underlying RDF and SPARQL

## Running AskOmics

AskOmics is available under two supports : Docker and VM Virtualbox.

Some (possibly outdated) documentation is also on the [AskOmics Wiki](https://github.com/askomics/askomics/wiki). It should migrate here some day.
